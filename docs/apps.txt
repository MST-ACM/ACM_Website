    forms.py
        This file is used for combining the Event Class model with a form
        (ModelForm). This ModelForm adds extra information about what to
        display on the form that is created. More information about ModelForm
        can be found `here <modelform-link_>`_.

        You can use different variables to change the way model fields will be
        displayed such as using the widget variable. For example, the title
        field of the model is changed with the widget variable to include
        having a Textarea (which is an HTML element used to define having a
        larger input area for text). To learn more about the changing the
        fields in the Class Meta, click `here <class-meta-fields_>`_.

    models.py
        This file is used to describe the database table for the Events model
        which include fields such as event title, data created, hosting sig,
        and many others. Inside the Event class, the method "is_active" is
        created as to add an additional check using the "@property" decorator.
        To learn more about how decorators work, visit
        `here <python-decorators_>`_.

        Before the Event class model is created, there is also a function named
        "get_path_for_flier". This function is automatically called when a new
        Event object is created and uses an "instance" of the Event object.
        This function is used to dynamically create a folder path for flier
        that uses the host date of the event. To learn about getting the
        instance of a model object, click `here <django-instances_>`_. Another
        useful site which looks to have something closer to what was done in
        our code can be found here `here <django-specific-instance_>`_.

        Things that still need to be possibly documented:

        * The part at the top of the file about stopping cirucular imports
        * The EventParticipation class at the bottom of the file.

    views.py
        The "list_events" is used for creating a view that list out all of the
        events in an organized manner. The other view function named
        "create_event" is used for authenticating user's who have permission to
        create events as well as actually adding the created event to the
        database.
