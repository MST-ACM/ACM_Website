              build production-grade websites using software engineering skills
              and development patterns with weekly development meetings.
              Currently, SIG.com is developing the https://acm.mst.edu/
              website. Moreover, we host workshops on various foundational
              skills such as Python, Git, HTML, CSS, and many others.</p>
