              within Missouri S&T’s ACM that focuses primarily on competitive
              programming. With weekly lectures from Dr. Morales we tackle
              challenge problems from many online judge websites such as Kattis
              (https://open.kattis.com/) and UVA (https://uva.onlinejudge.org/).
              We also hold our own programming contests on campus where people
              can win the admiration of their peers and some great prizes.</p>

              SIG-Data is a data focused org covering topics like Data Science,
              Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Data Engineering. Data Science,
              commonly seen as a combination of most data professions, is a new
              field with an infinite landscape. Our goal is to catalyze a new
              era of Data Science by using our curiosity to explore this
              landscape and push new standards. In SIG-Data, we participate in
              competition sites such as Kaggle, tell stories using data, learn
              what’s new in Data Science, and whatever is necessary to be
              cutting edge.</p>

              Missouri. We utilize many programming languages, tools and
              development strategies standard to the Computer Science Industry.
              Our members gain valuable experience on one of our five
              development teams: Arena, Game, Public Relations, Visualizer, and
              Web. SIG-Game offers experience working on a real team, with
              fellow students and mentors to learn and grow as a software

              turn ideas into reality. We organize travel and attendance to
              these events, which take place across the Midwest and the country.
              We also run PickHacks, the annual student-run hackathon held at
              S&T in March. Alongside hackathons, we also host events about
              various design thinking concepts, hackathon preparation, and much
              more. Skill level and major doesn’t matter here — as long as you
              like building new things and meeting awesome people, SIG-Hack
              is right for you.</p>
