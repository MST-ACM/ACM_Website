# What's it do?
`gulpfile.js` looks through `ACM_General/app/static/app/scss/` for sass
files to compile then drops them into `ACM_General/app/static/app/css/`

# What are the dependencies?
- `npm`
From `npm` install
  - `gulp`
  - `gulp-sass`
  - `glob`

Run `npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass glob`

# How do I run it?
Type `gulp` into the command line, that's it...
